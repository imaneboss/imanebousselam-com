title: Artuk Bey
description: Zaheer-ul-Daulah Artuk Beg, known as Artuk Bey, was a Turkmen
  commander of the Seljuk Empire in the 11th century, chief of the Oghuz tribe
  of Doger, and eponymous founder of the Artuqid dynasty.[2][3] His father's
  name was Eksük. He was the Seljuk governor of Jerusalem between 1085–1091.
  Although the Artuqid dynasty was named after him, actually the dynasty was

Artuk Bey was one of the commanders of the [Great Seljuk Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seljuk_Empire "Great Seljuk Empire") army during the [Battle of Manzikert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert "Battle of Manzikert") in 1071. After the battle, he took part in the conquest of [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") on behalf of the Seljuk Empire. He captured the [Yeşilırmak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye%C5%9Fil_River "Yeşil River") ([Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): Ἶρις) valley in 1074. In 1075, Artuk captured on behalf of the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") the Norman rebell [Roussel de Bailleul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roussel_de_Bailleul "Roussel de Bailleul") and handed him over to the future emperor [Alexios Komnenos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexios_I_Komnenos "Alexios I Komnenos").[\[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artuk_Bey#cite_note-Prosography-5) He also served the sultan by quashing a rebellion in 1077.[\[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artuk_Bey#cite_note-6)

His next mission was a campaign in 1086 to capture [Diyarbakır](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyarbak%C4%B1r "Diyarbakır") (Amid) from the [Marwanids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marwanids_(Diyar_Bakr) "Marwanids (Diyar Bakr)"). In this campaign he quarreled with the commander-in-chief [Fakhr al-Dawla ibn Jahir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhr_al-Dawla_ibn_Jahir "Fakhr al-Dawla ibn Jahir") who tended to make peace with Marwanids. In a surprise attack he defeated reinforcements to Marwanids. However, when the sultan [Malik Shah I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Shah_I "Malik Shah I") heard about the event he accused Artuk.[\[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artuk_Bey#cite_note-7)
